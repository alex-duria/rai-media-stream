Technical Interview Details
● You'll write a demo application showcasing the Recall API and functionality.
● The demo app should be written from the perspective of creating a demo application for
Recall customers to extend off of.
● You'll have 24 hours from when you get your test account to complete this.
● We'll have a call with you where you will demo the app and code.
● On the call, we'll also discuss how you'd improve the Recall API and docs - no need to
write anything up, this will purely be a verbal discussion.
Deliverable
● Link to Github repository of demo application.
What we’re looking for
● You'll be assessed on the quality of your code as well as written communication.
Specifically:
○ The structure of the project, including the code, repository structure, and
documentation.
○ The quality of the demo application. It doesn't need to be polished, but it should
be presentable.
○ The clarity of the code, comments, and Readme
○ The relevance of the demo app to our end customer. You don't have to have a
perfect idea of who our customers are, but you should be able to explain why you
chose a certain topic to build the app around.
